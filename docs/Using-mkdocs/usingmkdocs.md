# How to use MkDocs

## Installation

MkDocs requires Python, a programming language, but do not fear; you do not need to learn Python to build your first documentation site.

- If you already have Python installed, confirm by writing the following command in your terminal:
  ```python
  python - -version
  Then
  pip --version
  ```
- If something like this occurs, then you are good to go.
  > _The number may vary depending on the latest version the Python developers team releases._
  ```python

  ```
