# Understanding the MkDocs project Structure

When you type the command`mkdocs new my-project`, it creates some files automatically.

Here is a breakdown of those files and what they are for:

- `docs/` is a folder containing all your project's content. It has markdown (.md) files; It is mandatory to write in Markdown. Markdown is a markup language that is easy to learn and represents individual pages on your site. This folder can have folders created in it.
- `mkdocs.yml` is a vital file. MkDocs receives instructions from here. You can change the site name, add pages, add themes, and much more. Every significant change you make to your project must be in this file.
